Exact Match Keywords
What are exact-match keywords?
In SEO, exact-match keywords also refer to search results/content that perfectly match all of the keywords in the search query, exactly as entered. Historically, exact-match keywords are important for both organic and paid search, and are a frequent topic of SEO debates.

Exact-match keywords originated from the Google AdWords keyword match type that allows you to advertise on a specific exact-match search.
